[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "HEAD",
            "PUT",
            "POST",
            "DELETE"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "http://localhost:3000",
            "https://yourdomain.com",
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [

=== ALTERNATIVE: USE AWS CLI TO SET CORS ===

> install AWS CLI if not already installed

> configure AWS CLI with your credentials

> create a file named "cors.json" with the above CORS configuration

> run this command:
aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket YOUR-BUCKET-NAME --cors-configuration file://cors.json

=== FOR PRODUCTION ===

> replace "http://localhost:3000" with your actual domain
> replace "*" in AllowedOrigins with specific domains for security
